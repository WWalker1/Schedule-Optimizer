Final Project Devliverables: 
1. Account creation and security + Lasting habit tracking data 
2. Habit and routine building screen 
    - ability to create multiple habit dashboards. e.g. daily productivity trackers, weekly health trackers, work session productivity trackers
3. CRUD application for recording routine/habit logs 
4. customizable visualization dashboard. Shows progress and correlations of different elements 
5. Model building page which uses classical machine learning models to maximize/minimize certain behaviors and actions 
    - users can select target variables and introduce constraints to build effective models to "shape their days" 


Personal Goals: 
1. create work session habit with things like - 
    with phone, percent_time_finished, interruptions?, location, etc
2. Daily recorder like - sleep, num_meals, eat_out, money_spent, work_done,
