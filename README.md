Track your habits and create models to boost behaviors and squash vice


 Thank you! I'll continue with the design and provide ways to test the code. I'll also give you a quick explanation of how SQLite3 integrates with Python and provide a learning resource.

Let's continue by implementing user registration and login functionality, and then move on to habit creation and entry logging.




To test the code:
1. Run `python init_db.py` to initialize the database.
2. Run `python app.py` to start the Flask development server.
3. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
4. Try registering a new user, logging in, and viewing the index page.

Quick explanation of SQLite3 integration with Python:

SQLite3 is included in Python's standard library, making it easy to use without additional installations. The `sqlite3` module provides a simple interface for working with SQLite databases. Here's a brief overview:

1. Connect to a database: `conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')`
2. Create a cursor: `cur = conn.cursor()`
3. Execute SQL commands: `cur.execute('SQL COMMAND')`
4. Fetch results: `result = cur.fetchall()`
5. Commit changes: `conn.commit()`
6. Close the connection: `conn.close()`

In our code, we're using `conn.execute()` directly for simplicity, which combines steps 2 and 3.
